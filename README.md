# Utilizing-new-RL-algorithms-for-solving-combinatorial-optimization-problems-TSP-
This work extends over the different new algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) in solving the famous Combinatorial Optimization problem - Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Each of the method is tried out with minimal amount of code. 
Algorithms include Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Graph embedded DQN, Polict Gradient and Actor-Critic methods (A2C).
Out of all, A2C turned out to be the best in terms of execution time inspite of the very simple architecture used.
