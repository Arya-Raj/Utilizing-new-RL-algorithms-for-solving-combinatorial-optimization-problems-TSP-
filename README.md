# Utilizing-new-RL-algorithms-for-solving-combinatorial-optimization-problems-TSP-
This work extends over the different new algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) in solving the famous Combinatorial Optimization problem - Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Each of the method is tried out with minimal amount of code and same set up for all the methods for uniformity.
